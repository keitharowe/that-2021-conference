## Azure DevOps for Agencies; Automation of the Entire Ecosystem
### Slides, scripts, and examples from my 2021 THAT conference

Overview, in this session we will:
* Why DevOps is different for agencies, loads of short-term projects (6 months)
* How can we automate our Infrastructure to handle this load
* Focus on .NET and .NET Core applications
* Build and classic release pipelines, YAML, pipeline variables, library, key vaults, variable groups, tasks, parameters, templates, deployment groups (on-prem, cloud other, Azure)
* Task group management, versions, drafts, previews, limitations and API updates
* Best practices to keep secrets out of source code (and out of developer hands), connection strings, transforms, API keys, passwords
* SSL for all environments, localhost, dev, uat, stage, and production
* Infrastructure as code; no manual configurations
* Keeping things vanilla, limitations you might encounter
* Using DevOps to deploy your PowerShell deployment scripts with versions
* Touch on GitHub Actions
* Copy file routines
* Future enhancements: SQL data seeds
* Automated tear down of assets
